# Professional Portfolio

## Purpose

I developed this professional portfolio to showcase my creative projects, deployed websites and links to my react application and github account. I include 2 short introductory bodies outlining my character (area of focus), skills and experience. Additionally, i implemented a functional contact form to get in touch with me via email using services by Emailjs.
